      "Bond funds recover appeal after painful falls\n",
      "Exchange traded funds that track bond markets have endured a torrid time this year as galloping inflation has forced central banks to raise interest rates aggressively, in an effort to restore price stability.\n",
      "Investors have been warned to expect more increases in interest rates in the US, UK and EU as increased volatility in global energy and food prices — resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine — creates greater uncertainty over the future path for inflation.\n",
      "Meanwhile, widespread losses have been registered across some of the world’s most popular fixed income ETFs. Bond prices, which move inversely to interest rates, have dropped as central banks have signalled that tighter monetary policy will be necessary until policymakers are confident that inflation has been brought under control.\n",
      "As a result, the 10 largest fixed income ETFs by assets have all delivered negative total returns in the first eight months of this year: ranging from minus 3.4 per cent for SHY — BlackRock’s $26.6bn iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF — to minus 16.1 per cent for LQD — BlackRock’s $32.9bn iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF.\n",
      "The biggest ETFs in high-yield bonds and emerging market debt have also suffered significant losses by September. HYG — BlackRock’s $12.3bn iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF — has lost 14.1 per cent this year and its direct competitor JNK — State Street’s $5.9bn SPDR Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF — has dropped 12.8 per cent. At the same time, EEM — BlackRock’s $22.6bn iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF — has fallen 18.2 per cent.\n",
      "But this repricing has been accompanied by shifts in positioning by large institutional investors. Many are abandoning their earlier caution and are now more willing to allocate more funds to the asset class.\n",
      "A net 40 per cent of asset allocators held “underweight” bond positions in September, according to a survey by Bank of America of 212 investment managers with combined assets of $616bn. However, that was an improvement in sentiment compared with the net 80 per cent “underweight” recorded in October 2021 — the most pessimistic reading in the 20-year history of the survey.\n",
      "The risk-reward balance for bond investors has improved because of the price falls, according to Amundi, the Paris based-asset manager.\n",
      "“Bonds are back,” says Vincent Mortier, group chief investment officer at Amundi. “After the great repricing in the first half of the year, and as we move to an environment with a higher risk of recession, government bonds are worth looking at as yields are now more appealing.”\n",
      "Investor appetite for government bond ETFs has strengthened, accordingly. Global net inflows were $118.4bn in the first eight months of this year — already more than double the $47.1bn gathered over the whole of 2021, according to ETFGI, a London-based consultancy.\n",
      "Bonds are back — government bonds are worth looking at as yields are now more appealing\n",
      "“The US has been the main driver of the increased inflows into government bond ETFs this year, along with a notable improvement in Europe,” says Deborah Fuhr, chief executive of the ETFGI consultancy. “At the same time, continuing investor caution is evident across inflation-linked bond ETFs, high yield, and emerging market fixed income ETFs, which have all registered net global outflows so far this year.”\n",
      "Michael John Lytle, the chief executive of Tabula, a London-based ETF provider, says sentiment toward credit that is investment grade and high yield improved following the weakness in the first half of 2022.\n",
      "“Developments in bond markets in the first half were undoubtedly painful for fixed-income investors,” he acknowledges. “Although it is not clear where policy on interest rate rises will peak, spreads in both investment grade and high yield markets have widened and are now much more attractive.”\n",
      "Fears of acute inflation remain a major problem for fixed-income investors, though. BlackRock says the threat that high inflation rates will persist is still being underestimated by investors. But the world’s largest asset manager thinks that both the US Federal Reserve and ECB will be forced to stop raising interest rates once the gravity of the damage being done to the economy and employment by monetary tightening becomes clearer.\n",
      "BlackRock has a “neutral” tactical view on EU government bonds and an “underweight” on holding US Treasuries. It is recommending clients should overweight inflation-linked bonds and also investment-grade credit. “The strong balance sheets of high-quality corporate bond issuers suggest that investment-grade credit should weather weaker economic growth better than equities,” says Karim Chedid, head of investment strategy for iShares in the Emea region at BlackRock.\n",
      "He adds that investors looking for income should also consider LEMB — BlackRock’s $373mn iShares JPMorgan EM Local Currency Bond ETF — which has an attractive yield.\n",
      "“Local currency emerging market debt offers attractive valuations and income. Higher yields already reflect monetary policy tightening in emerging markets and compensation for inflation risks,” says Chedid.\n",

      "Economy Looks Worse than Fed Would Like, Markets Will Struggle until Inflation's Controlled\n",
      "On Friday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Way Too Early,” CNBC International Financial Journalist Arabile Gumede said that we can expect markets to have difficulties until inflation is controlled and that the economy doesn’t look as good as central banks would like.\n",
      "Host Jonathan Lemire asked, “With more rate hikes possible — likely from the Fed, should we expect the markets writ large to continue to struggle?”\n",
      "Gumede responded, “Yeah, certainly, until we get inflation under control will certainly be the question [mark] around how the market sort of reacts to that. The negativity is certainly going to be a key impact. Also, economic data will certainly prove itself to be very important and significant to where exactly the market goes, right? So, there is a sense of recovery coming back into the markets somewhat, having seen that broad selloff, as you know, yesterday, major indices dropping off, with the S&P hitting its lowest level since November 2020. As you noted, the S&P and the NASDAQ even saw their worst day since September 13, actually. So, around two weeks or so in terms of the volume of dropoff there. So, it does give you a sense then of how things are looking quite nervous at this point in time. But with inflation still at the high levels it is, the economy certainly not looking as bright as…the central bank would like it to be, you certainly are going to see quite a bit of nervousness trading in that market picture. But, will that selloff continue? It will be fully dependent on the measures taken from here from the central banks.”\n",

      "Investors Expect No Peace in Stocks Until Bond Gyrations Subside\n",
      "Investors believe the feedback loop between U.S. stocks and bonds will likely be a key factor in determining whether the gyrations that have rocked markets this year continue into the last months of 2022.\n",
      "With the third quarter over, both assets have seen painful sell-offs - the S&P 500 is down nearly 25% year-to-date and the ICE BofA Treasury Index has fallen by around 13%. The twin declines are the worst since 1938, according to BoFA Global Research.\n",
      "Yet many investors say bonds have led the dance, with soaring yields slamming stock valuations as market participants recalibrated their portfolios to account for stronger-than-expected monetary tightening from the Fed.\n",
      "The S&P 500’s forward price-to-earnings ratio fell from 20 in April to its current level of 16.1, a move that came alongside a 140 basis point surge in the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury, which moves inversely to prices.\n",
      "\"Interest rates are at the core of every asset in the universe, and we won’t have a positive repricing in equities until the uncertainty of where the terminal rate will settle is clear,” said Charlie McElligott, managing director of cross-asset strategy at Nomura.\n",
      "Volatility in U.S. bonds has erupted in 2022, with this week’s Treasury yield gyrations taking the ICE BofAML U.S. Bond Market Option Volatility Estimate Index to its highest level since March 2020. By contrast, the Cboe Volatility Index - the so-called Wall Street \"fear gauge\" - has failed to scale its peak from earlier this year.\n",
      "“We have emphasized ... that interest rate volatility has been (and continues to be) the main driver of cross-asset volatility. Nevertheless, even we continue to watch the rates volatility complex with incredulity,” analysts at Soc Gen wrote.\n",
      "Many investors believe the wild moves will continue until there is evidence that the Fed is winning its battle against inflation, allowing policymakers to eventually end monetary tightening. For now, more hawkishness is on the menu.\n",
      "Investors on Friday afternoon were pricing in a 57% chance that the U.S. central bank hikes rates by 75 basis point rates at its Nov. 2 meeting, up from a 0% chance one month ago, according to CME's FedWatch tool. Markets see rates hitting a peak of 4.5% in July 2023, up from 4% a month ago.\n",
      "Next week’s U.S. employment data will give investors a snapshot of whether the Fed’s rate hikes are starting to dent growth. Investors are also looking to earnings season, which starts in October, as they gauge to what degree a strong dollar and supply chain snafus will affect companies’ profits.\n",
      "For now, investor sentiment is largely negative, with cash levels among fund managers near historic highs as many increasingly choose to sit out the market swings. Retail investors sold a net $2.9 billion of equities in the past week, the second largest outflow since March 2020, data from JPMorgan showed on Wednesday.\n",
      "Still, some investors believe a turnaround in stocks and bonds may soon come into view.\n",
      "The deep declines in both asset classes make either an attractive investment given the likelihood of longer-term returns, said Adam Hetts, global head of portfolio construction and strategy at Janus Henderson Investors.\n",
      "\"We've been in a world where nothing was working. Most of that agony is over, we think,\" he said.\n",
      "JPMorgan’s analysts, meanwhile, said high cash allocations may provide a backstop for both equities and bonds, likely limiting future downside.\n",
      "At the same time, the fourth quarter is historically the best period for returns for major U.S. stock indexes, with the S&P 500 averaging a 4.2% gain since 1949, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac.\n",
      "Of course, dip buying has fared poorly this year. The S&P 500 has mounted four rallies of 6% or more this year, with each rebound sputtering out to be followed by fresh bear market lows.\n",
      "Wei Li, Chief Investment Strategist at BlackRock Investment Institute, believes more jumbo rate hikes from the Fed may dent growth, while a slower pace of tightening could hurt bonds by making inflation more entrenched.\n",
      "She is underweight developed market equities and fixed income, believing that “difficult choices” faced by central banks will spur more market ructions.\n",
      "Equities may have further to fall than bonds given the high likelihood of a recession in 2023, said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer and chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services.\n",
      "\"We think the upside for equities will be capped because there will be more earnings pain and more central bank tightening,\" he said.\n",

      "Street investors' volatility rodeo\n",
      "The historic turbulence in the markets during the third quarter tested investors' nerves, but some of Wall Street's biggest names are reaping their best returns in years by benefiting from the wild swings in different asset classes. It was the first time in about 80 years where the S & P 500 suffered a quarterly loss after being up more than 10% at one point, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Meanwhile, crazy moves are also being seen in bond yields, currencies and commodities as the Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to rate hikes in its inflation battle. The extreme volatility bodes particularly well for macro players, who make bets around political and economic events. Ray Dalio's hedge fund firm Bridgewater is on pace to post its best year since 2010 with its Pure Alpha II fund rising 32.7% through Sept. 23, according to a person familiar with the firm's returns. Citadel is also having a stellar year, with its multi-strategy flagship fund Wellington rallying more than 25% through the end of August, according to a person familiar with the returns. Bridgewater and Citadel executives have described their views on the central bank's tightening path and their economic outlook in recent public appearances. At CNBC's Delivering Alpha conference in New York City on Wednesday, Ken Griffin , Citadel's founder and CEO, said he believes the Fed has more work to do to bring down inflation even after a series of big rate hikes. He added there could be a chance for a recession next year. In mid-September, at the SALT conference, Bridgewater co-CIO Greg Jensen said the belief that inflation is going to normalize to around 3% over time is too optimistic. The widely followed strategist said he expects price pressures are going to stay \"stubbornly higher than the market expects.\" Persistent inflation, combined with slowing growth in the U.S., will continue to weigh on asset prices, Jensen said. Asked about where to put money to work right now, Jensen said Latin America and commodity assets look relatively attractive. Dalio recently issued a pessimistic warning for the markets, predicting the policy of keeping interest rates elevated to squash inflation could tank stock prices by 20%. Tech investors buying the dip While macro players took advantage of the market mayhem, tech-focused investors suffered more losses this quarter on the back of rising rates. Cathie Wood's flagship ARK Innovation ETF lost about 4% in the third quarter, suffering its fifth negative quarter in a row. The innovation investor has been busy buying the dip in the market, snapping up shares of her tech darlings during the sell-off including two of her largest holdings, Roku and Zoom Video. Bracing for the fourth quarter Markets plagued by increasing economic uncertainty and geopolitical risk in fourth quarter Wall Street analysts' favorite stocks for the fourth quarter include a casino name that could double No more 'TINA:' The case for putting money into cash, short-term bonds in this volatile market The fourth quarter starts now, and it's not looking good for the economy Altimeter Capital CEO Brad Gerstner is in a middle of a tough year as well. Some of his top holdings have racked up steep losses. Microsoft dropped more than 8% in the third quarter, while Meta Platforms lost 15%. Snowflake and Uber , however, rebounded during the period. In mid-September, Gerstner revealed a new position in Tesla , betting on the industry leader amid the global trend toward vehicle electrification. Value investors didn't buckle Some of the biggest value investors also kept themselves busy during the Fed-triggered stock rout. Leon Cooperman said he's having a \"decent\" year relative to the major stock indexes, and he's finding a lot of individual stocks that are attractively priced. The CEO of the Omega Family Office said he's keeping his expectations low as investors are still stuck in a bad environment. Warren Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway bought more shares of Occidental Petroleum this week, continuing to add to its massive stake as the legendary investor remains unfazed by the pullback in oil prices. Berkshire's stake in Occidental has now reached 20.8%. The bet has steadily increased over the past few months. In August, Buffett's firm received regulatory approval to purchase up to 50%, spurring speculation that it may eventually buy all of Houston-based energy company.\n",

      "Heather Thomas can count out the tragedies that pulled her family of eight into poverty. She and her husband lost their jobs and home, their small business folded, multiple relatives died and health crises pushed them into medical debt.\n",
      "\"It just went from a drip to a flood very quickly. And we just lost it all,\" Thomas recalled.\n",
      "\"Food was really, really, really tight. My husband's health, because of his conditions, there were times we just couldn't eat right. And one of his health conditions ended up getting a lot worse. We were rationing diapers... It was really bad.\"\n",
      "They're among the more than 1.2 million people who struggled to put food on the table at some point last year in the Washington, D.C. region. That's a third of the population living in and around the capital of one of the richest nations on Earth.\n",
      "Nationwide, more than 33 million people, including five million children, are food insecure, according to the USDA. No community is spared, with rural areas, families with children and communities of color disproportionately affected.\n",
      "This week, the White House hosted its first conference on hunger in a generation, unveiling a national strategy that included decreasing obesity and diet-related disease — such as diabetes — through healthier eating, good nutrition and physical activity. The private sector and charities have committed eight billion dollars. But a divided Congress could set back some of the Biden administration's broader proposals that could help lift people like Heather out of poverty.\n",
      "Living in poverty can trauma\n",
      "Thomas, 47, was not always on this side of the poverty line. A social worker by training, she used to give bags of food and other donations to kids in need. In the not-so-distant past, the family lived in a three-story townhome they shared with Thomas's grandmother.\n",
      "\"Both my husband and I are college educated. My husband is an honorably discharged combat vet. And we've always worked since we were teenagers. I've worked in social services, in the human services field for over 30 years. And my husband served the military. And then when he got out, he's worked in different jobs,\" she said. \"This could happen to anybody.\"\n",
      "She spoke after picking up free groceries from the food pantry run by Western Fairfax Christian Ministries in Chantilly, Va. Signs on the sparse shelves indicated limits on some of the products — a pound of meat, two gallons of milk, two dozen eggs or five cans of soup per person. And she's only allowed one visit to the pantry per month.\n",
      "\"Living in poverty makes you sicker or causes you to become sick if you aren't and it's hard to get out of,\" Thomas said. \"No matter how long you live in it, it causes trauma,\" she added, noting the stress caused her and her husband to develop PTSD, bringing her lupus and rheumatoid arthritis out of remission. The trauma in turn trickled down to the children, whose health has also \"gone downhill.\"\n",

      "A common scenario\n",
      "As stark as it may be, their story is not unique.\n",
      "\"Coming out of the height of the pandemic with inflation being as sustained and high as it is, it's a hard time for many families,\" said Radha Muthiah, CEO of the Capital Area Food Bank. \"As we are thinking about how our nation rebuilds in a more equitable and inclusive manner, food and food programs have a really critical role to play.\"\n",
      "Her group distributed more than 64 million meals last year — more than any previous year and double 2019 levels. Meeting the growing needs of the most destitute people has required a fair amount of innovation. The food bank's Curbside Groceries is a store on wheels that has at least 12 stops in food desert areas. That includes Washington's Ward Eight, a predominantly Black area with higher poverty whose approximately 80,000 residents have very limited access to full-service grocery stores.\n",
      "\"When they're working multiple jobs, as most of our clients are, and they're having to drop off or pick up their kids from school, childcare, one or two hours to get to the grocery store is really quite a distance,\" Muthiah said.\n",
      "\"Systemic racism, lack of access to education, lack of mentorship, lack of access to banks, financial instruments, wealth building tools, lack of access to affordable housing — all of these things are at the root of food insecurity. And it's important, therefore, not just to address things at the surface and some of the symptoms, but also to address these root causes.\"\n",
      "At Children's National Hospital, the Capital Area Food Bank has set up a food pharmacy so that doctors can prescribe healthy food to complement medical and clinical care.\n",
      "Good nutrition is especially critical for children, whose minds and bodies are still growing.\n",
      "\"When they have that, they can focus and they can learn and they can absorb and they can dream and they can aspire,\" Muthiah explained.\n",

      "Communities of color are hit hard\n",
      "In good times and bad, Carla Claure peels, cuts and slices the freshest produce and meat she can find for her husband and her teenage daughters Alejandra and Daniela by the dim light of her prefabricated home. \"It's beans, tortillas, maseca — I make my own tortillas — tomatoes and some cheese. It's good food. It's healthy food. It's good for the families too,\" Claure said as she prepared tostadas.\n",
      "But fresh fruit, vegetables and meat are also some of the most expensive items at the store. And with rent costing nearly a thousand dollars a month, the food budget gets stretched thin.\n",
      "Claure, 45, is from Bolivia and her husband is from Mexico. They live in a nearly entirely Hispanic trailer community in Alexandria, Va.\n",
      "They both lost their jobs at the start of the pandemic — she couldn't clean homes anymore due to her clients' COVID fears, and work stopped at her husband's construction sites. So they had to rely on food stamps and donated produce.\n",
      "Now, Carla helps facilitate distributions of donated food she and her neighbors can use. \"Normally, I have food distribution here on Wednesday, fresh fruit. I have some there for a couple of days. And the rest I buy in Aldi. It's not expensive. Or sometimes it's in the Latino supermarket; it's good price too,\" Claure said.\n",
      "Some of their neighbors are undocumented migrants who aren't able to access many benefits — or fear retribution if they try. \"For Spanish [Hispanic] people without documents, whether your kids are citizens or not, you are not able to receive anything else... You are not able to make application for food stamps too,\" Claure said. \"That's really hard for the kids, especially for kids, because the kids don't understand why we don't have food.\"\n",
      "Muthiah, the regional food bank chief, says households of color with children struggle the most to put food on the table, with two-thirds of those families impacted by food insecurity.\n",
      "\"While the numbers across the board are unacceptably high, they are ridiculously high for those who are of minority population,\" she added.\n",

      "Food insecurity can come with stigma\n",
      "Back at the pantry, Thomas said being poor requires sacrifices. She's had to make tough choices when deciding what to buy on her limited budget.\n",
      "\"You get very protective of the food because you can't just go out there and get exactly what you want. And sometimes parents don't eat, or they eat very little, so that their kids can eat,\" she said. \"The junk food and the processed food is so much cheaper than the healthy food. What's wrong with that picture?\"\n",
      "Thomas called for having more people like her — with lived experience in poverty — to have a voice in policymaking on hunger. She's already active in that space herself — she and other advocates met with Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge last month.\n",
      "\"I would challenge anybody who does have what's considered a living wage to live on a sub-living wage. They wouldn't get very far,\" Thomas said. \"You become creative and then you learn how to go without things, like Q-tips and other things that we take for granted become, like, prizes, right — Oh, cool, we got Q-tip money this month!\"\n",

      "Even today, six years after she fell into poverty, Thomas still hesitates telling people she relies on aid for food and housing. It took a full-fledged effort that lasted two years to find the appropriate programs for her family and fill out the associated paperwork before she finally received those benefits.\n",
      "\"You feel a lot of shame with it and people judging you,\" she said. \"When you go to the store, it becomes like this secret.\"\n",

      "The great guinea pig giveaway has begun\n",
      "In recent weeks, so many people have called Bill Crain’s Hudson Valley farm rescue to surrender their ducks and chickens — many purchased at the height of the pandemic lockdown — that he finally marched into a local farm store and demanded to speak to a manager. His plea: Stop selling chicks and ducklings.\n",
      "“They think the pandemic is over, and they don’t want to devote time to taking care of them anymore,” Crain, 78, said in an interview from his Safe Haven Farm Sanctuary in Poughquag, New York, where he said there are so many calls from people hoping to give up their pets that he must turn birds away — his coops are full.\n",
      "“It’s a crisis that people are abandoning these animals,” he said.\n",
      "One of the slim silver linings of the pandemic’s earliest days was the addition of animals to many families. Some people, decamping from virus-besieged cities for the countryside, stoked a craze for backyard fowl. There was an emptying of animal shelters as people stuck at home found unexpected room in their lives for cats and dogs. Socially distant and lonely, or with kids to entertain, many cleared pet store shelves of gerbils and lizards, chinchillas and snakes.\n",
      "Gloomy prognostications of a swift, post-pandemic boomerang of dogs and cats back to shelters do not appear to be bearing out. But as the world rights itself — workers back in offices, students back in school — other sorts of pets are apparently not so lucky. Those who rescue and advocate for smaller animals fear that they are seeing the beginning of a tide of reptiles, birds and rodents — even some fish — given up by once enthusiastic families.\n",
      "Small animal surrenders spiked by more than 50% nationwide in the first six months of 2022, compared to the same period the year before, according to Shelter Animals Count, which collects data from more than 6,000 shelters, though they still remain about 20% lower than pre-pandemic. In contrast, surrenders of cats and dogs have climbed less than 7% over the year before, and are still about 15% below 2019 levels.\n",
      "Advertising\n",
      "In New York City, so many guinea pigs have flooded the city’s animal shelter system — 600 so far this year, more than double pre-pandemic numbers — that the City Council is considering a bill that would ban their sale in pet shops. Most are under 3 years old, indicating they were pandemic purchases, said Katy Hansen, a spokesperson for the city’s shelter system, Animal Care Centers of New York City. The population spike has forced the shelters to invest in a new $20,000 guinea pig tower, where the animals live stacked in sliding trays.\n",
      "On Wednesday, a box containing 22 guinea pigs of all ages was found abandoned in the lobby of a Staten Island apartment building, Hansen said. “This situation has become untenable,” she said. “We are at our wits end.”\n",
      "There are other, less quantifiable warnings: Some city pet store owners say that customers who at the height of the pandemic scooped up creatures such as hamsters and bearded dragon lizards as playmates for cooped-up children have brought them back.\n",
      "People who foster guinea pigs in New York say they are overrun. In Central Park, rescues of domestic red-eared slider turtles nearly tripled to 29 this year so far — though the parks department cautioned that the numbers could mean more sightings of distressed turtles, not more animals. Rabbits and guinea pigs have also been found. It is illegal to release animals in city parks.\n",
      "A constellation of factors is apparently driving the surge. Christa Chadwick, vice president of shelter services at the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, suggested that part of the uptick may be because many shelters were not taking in animals over the course of the pandemic. And, she noted, shelters are glutted with small animals in part because adoptions overall have slowed.\n",
      "“It’s important for the public to come back in droves to shelters,” she said. “Whether it is for cats or dogs or chickens or hamsters.”\n",
      "Advertising\n",
      "Rising rents, inflation and housing insecurity have also forced people to make difficult decisions about keeping even beloved pets, said Hilary Hager, vice president of outreach, engagement and training at the Humane Society of the United States. “I would never want to suggest to anyone that people don’t care,” Hager said. “There are just a lot of other factors that are coming into play.”\n",
      "Jade Perez’s family acquired a dog and two kittens to stave off the loneliness of lockdown, she said. But when rising rents forced her family to downsize to a smaller Staten Island apartment, she put Honey, the guinea pig she had bought just before the pandemic, up for adoption on Craigslist.\n",
      "“We have a lot of animals, and we just can’t take care of the guinea pig now,” said Jade, who is 17, citing inflation’s toll on the prices of food and supplies. “He’s not living the best life he can.”\n",
      "Petqua, a pet store on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, is now the temporary home of two guinea pigs, three turtles and a tiny school of betta fish, all recently relinquished by their owners. Some are castaways from the flurry of pet purchases at the start of the pandemic, according to Sam Laroche, who operates the shop. He accepts surrenders — even those not purchased from his shop — and finds them new homes.\n",
      "He is expecting a leopard gecko soon, from a man who said he was moving and couldn’t take his lizard with him. “He’s very sad,” Laroche said.\n",
      "The phenomenon is also international. In England, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals reported a 24% increase in reports of abandoned animals from January to July over the same time period last year. That included 3,363 abandoned exotic pets, among them 1,455 fish and 685 snakes.\n",
      "Advertising\n",
      "In September, during the society’s “Guinea Pig Awareness Week,” it announced it had seen a 90% increase in guinea pig abandonments, on top of a 49% increase in rabbits.\n",
      "Why families are holding onto cats and dogs but relinquishing smaller animals may have to do with human attachment, several experts said. On Staten Island, Jade said she was able to bear parting with her guinea pig because Honey was less interactive than her dog and cats.\n",
      "“They look adorable, but I think people have this misguided conception they are going to be able to provide this companionship and fill a void that the are looking for,” said Allie Taylor, president of Voters for Animal Rights, a nonprofit organization that pushed for New York City’s guinea pig bill. “And when they don’t, the animal ends up paying an ultimate price.”\n",
      "At Safe Haven farm, where the aviaries are filled with 98 rescued fowl, Bill Crain and his wife Ellen, 78, have taken to urging callers to give their birds a second chance.\n",
      "They’ve had at least one success: When a man from Manhattan called to surrender pandemic ducklings because his family was summering in Nantucket, the Crains played on his conscience to reconsider: “We said look, it would be a good model for your kids,” Crain said.\n",
      "The man took the ducks with him on vacation.\n",

Here are five stocks picked by Wall Street's top professionals, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their track record.\n",
      "GXO Logistics\n",
      "Pure-play contract logistics provider GXO Logistics (GXO) focuses on leveraging technology to manage supply chains and warehousing. This firm addresses a highly underserved corner of e-commerce: reverse logistics, or the movement of goods from customers back to sellers. In the second quarter, 40% of the company's new business wins came from reverse logistics. Since it debuted in the public markets in 2021 — a spin-off from XPO Logistics — GXO has managed to close a billion-dollar deal to acquire reverse logistics leader Clipper Logistics. This acquisition also solidified GXO's stronghold in the reverse-logistics market. (See GXO Logistics Risk Factors on TipRanks) However, macroeconomic headwinds from Europe and the U.K. are weighing on the company's financials. After pricing in the headwinds that are expected to remain an overhang for some more time, Cowen analyst Jason Seidl recently reduced his near-term price target on GXO to $62 from $67. Seidl noted that about 70% of GXO's sales are in foreign currencies, primarily in pounds and euros. Sustained currency headwinds from Europe due to the Russia-Ukraine war had led GXO to guide a $30 million impact on revenues in 2023. However, the sliding pound has led the analyst to expect further impact. Nonetheless, the analyst remains firm on his buy rating, saying that GXO's variable cost structure is capable of mitigating adverse margin impacts. For those who can stomach the near-term worries, Seidl recommends buying the stock. \"Given where GXO is trading, we see an attractive entry point for long-term investors who are looking for quality transportation/logistics exposure that can weather the systematic storm in Europe,\" said the analyst, who has been ranked No. 8 among almost 8,000 analysts tracked on the platform. Importantly, 67% of Seidl's ratings have been profitable, with each rating generating returns of 23.9% on average.\n",
      "Nova\n",
      "Nova (NVMI) provides some heavy-duty metrology solutions to the semiconductor manufacturing market. The company's balanced revenue mix between foundry and memory has helped it hedge its business against exposure to a single end market. Recently, Needham analyst Quinn Bolton weighed in on Nova, reiterating a buy rating and $120 price target on the company. \"We like Nova for its strong foothold in the foundry and memory markets and its consistent focus on developing new technologies to meet the need for metrology in semiconductor manufacturing,\" said the analyst. (See Nova Measuring Stock Chart on TipRanks) Unlike many other types of process control equipment, optical critical dimension solutions do not face the risk of diminishing demand with growing wafer capacity. In fact, they scale linearly with it. Now, Nova has about a 70% share in the OCD market, which gives it a strong runway for growth as wafer capacities expand with the proliferation of advanced technologies. Bolton is also upbeat about Nova's prospects in the X-ray technology market. The analyst expects the X-ray tech market to \"grow in both front-end metrology and in advanced packaging applications.\" \"We believe Nova will be a metrology supplier of choice for the foreseeable future, and believe Nova will easily reach the $1 billion target even with extremely conservative assumptions,\" said Bolton. Bolton is ranked at No.3 of nearly 8,000 analysts on TipRanks' database. Notably, 62% of his ratings have successfully returned an average of 38% per rating.\n",
      "TD SYNNEX\n",
      "IT business process services provider TD SYNNEX (SNX) is benefiting from the high demand for remote working and learning software, as well as hardware solutions. Moreover, rapid digital transformation has kept the IT spending environment favorable for the business. The company recently released its quarterly results, beating the top and the bottom lines. However, like its other tech peers, economic headwinds are not sparing TD SYNNEX. Barrington Research analyst Vincent Colicchio reduced his price target to $98 from $106 to reflect the headwinds impacting the business in the coming few months. Nonetheless, Colicchio believes that the combined powers of SYNNEX and Tech Data (with which it merged last year) will help the company realize solid revenue and cost synergies. This will aid earnings growth over the next few years. (See TD Synexx Corporation Blogger Opinions & Sentiment on TipRanks) \"The company's revenue should grow faster than overall IT spending as it increases its investment in fast-growing technologies. We are confident in management's ability to achieve or exceed its targeted cost synergies of $200 million given a solid track record of execution on acquisitions,\" weighed in Colicchio. The analyst reiterated his buy rating on the stock, saying that the shares are trading at an attractive discount. Colicchio has placed at No. 581 among the almost 8,000 analysts followed on TipRanks. The analyst has a success rate of 52%, and each of his ratings has garnered average returns of 8.5%.\n",
      "Alphabet\n",
      "As the tech sector grapples with multiple economic blows, Alphabet (GOOGL) has been working on new devices to launch at its upcoming \"Made by Google\" event. (See Alphabet Class A Stock Investors sentiments on TipRanks) Ahead of the releases, Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Brian White, who is a Google bull, maintained his buy rating on the stock. \"We believe Alphabet is well positioned to capitalize on the long-term digital ad trend, participate in the shift of workloads to the cloud, and benefit from digital transformation,\" said White, justifying his long-term bullish view on Alphabet. Additionally, Alphabet's strong capabilities in AI give the company the upper hand to enhance the experiences of consumers. Also, White is encouraged by the fact that in the second quarter of the year, Apple held only 15.6% of global smartphone shipments. This means Android has the higher share in the operating system market. White, who holds the 470th position among nearly 8,000 analysts rated on TipRanks, maintained his target price of $145 on GOOGL stock. The analyst has a 56% success rate and 9.6% average returns on each of his ratings.\n",

      "My 2023 Forecast For High-Yield CEFs\n",
      "Road to success concept and sustainable development idea getty\n",
      "Plenty of folks are starting to look toward the new year, and I’m getting a lot of questions about my outlook for high-yield closed-end funds (CEFs) for the rest of ’22 and into ’23.\n",
      "Of course, no one has a crystal ball when it comes to CEFs, stocks or the economy in the short run, but my take is that we’ll likely see continued volatility in the back end of 2022, with better conditions in 2023, as the so-called “terminal rate” of the Fed’s hiking cycle comes into view.\n",
      "Luckily, there are CEFs out there called covered-call funds that are purpose-built for this environment, handing us safe 7%+ dividends that actually get stronger when volatility picks up. I’ll share a ticker with you that’s paying 7.7% now in a moment.\n",
      "As I wrote on September 8, this is a particularly good time to get into these funds, which use a unique option strategy to increase their dividend payouts when volatility rises. And with fear running as high as it is, we can safely say that more volatility is on its way—take a look at the latest read of the closely followed CNN Fear & Greed Index:\n",
      "CNN Fear/Greed Index CNN\n",
      "This sets up a perfect two-step plan for us: buy covered-call funds like the one below now and then shift into “pure” equity-focused CEFs when things calm down (as covered-call funds tend to underperform in a rising market) in 2023.\n",
      "Why do I see the market returning to health next year? Because there are many good-news stories that have yet to break through the gloomy mood out there. They include:\n",
      "1) Low Unemployment\n",
      "The best news about the US economy is that Americans are having no problem getting work, with unemployment at a decade low.\n",
      "Job Market Hangs Tough\n",
      "US Unemployment Very Low Federal Reserve\n",
      "This has also meant that Americans are earning more than ever, with average weekly earnings hitting an all-time high in 2022 and growing at a faster pace than they have in decades.\n",
      "Incomes Rising\n",
      "US Income Continues to Grow Federal Reserve\n",
      "2) Profits Remain Strong\n",
      "The way you normally hear it, prices are soaring because costs are spiking as businesses are forced to pay higher wages, as well as higher costs for raw materials. That could give you the impression that profits are suffering—but they’re not.\n",
      "Higher profits largely stem from the broad base of consumers who, thanks to rising income and lower unemployment, now have money to spend. And American firms continue to earn strong profits as a result.\n",
      "3) The Fed Is Likely Near the End of Its Rate-Hike Cycle\n",
      "Let’s be honest, markets are mainly tanking right now because of the Federal Reserve. With the Fed now hinting that interest rates could be hiked into February (previously, they expected hikes to end in December), there’s now fear that rates will rise higher and stay high for longer. But the numbers are starting to tell a different story.\n",
      "The First Sign the Fed Might Back Off\n",
      "In August, for example, the US producer price index fell on a month-over-month basis, which hasn’t happened since the start of the pandemic. These are the costs companies bear when producing goods and services: a decline usually means two things are about to happen: higher profits (as inputs are getting cheaper while the market is tolerating the prices these firms are charging) and lower inflation (a decline in costs means companies can increase their profits without raising prices).\n",
      "While it’s early days, there is a clear hint that inflation could start falling quickly over the next few months, which could mean the Fed has less reason to keep raising rates into 2023, as the market currently expects.\n",
      "Volatility Now, Recovery Later\n",
      "In a market like this, our best move is to protect ourselves from short-term downside while getting exposure to longer-term upside, thanks to today’s cheap stock prices. And as I mentioned earlier, a covered-call CEF like the Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX) is tailor-made to do that.\n",
      "Buy SPXX and you get three things:\n",
      "Exposure to the S&P 500 in its entirety, including top constituents like Apple AAPL (AAPL), Microsoft MSFT (MSFT) and Visa V (V), so when stocks start to recover, your portfolio will rise, too. A reliable 7.7% income stream, thanks to the covered calls SPXX sells (the fund collects money from the option sales it makes on its portfolio, whether or not the trades actually complete). This strategy does well when volatility picks up, making the fund’s income stream even more reliable in turbulent times. “Insurance” from downside, thanks to those covered calls: higher volatility increases the value of SPXX’s covered calls, helping cushion its per-share portfolio value.\n",
      "If the market is going back to the slow recovery from capitulation we saw in the summer, the next few months of uncertainty could mean superior profits for SPXX while we wait for brighter days to come. We’ll collect its 7.7% dividend while we do.\n",

      "Health care bills rising, here’s why\n",
      "Skyrocketing rent and food costs have company. Health costs also are soaring — and they’re likely to rise much more, which could help keep overall inflation elevated for some time, experts say.\n",
      "Inflation is expected to boost annual U.S. national health expenses by $370 billion by 2027 compared with pre-pandemic projections, consulting firm McKinsey estimates.\n",
      "The medical care index — part of the consumer price index — accelerated to 0.7% in August from 0.4% in July. Over the past year, it was up 5.4% — the largest 12-month increase since 1993 but still below the overall 8.3% pace of inflation.\n",
      "That lag in health care inflation to overall consumer inflation could be an ominous sign for consumers.\n",
      "“This is unusual, as health prices historically outpace prices in the rest of the economy,” said a team of analysts led by Emma Wager pg the Peterson-Kaiser Health System Tracker in a recent report. “This may lead to steeper premium increases in the coming years.”\n",
      "Why is health care getting more expensive?\n",
      "Higher costs of supplies and labor are contributing to the increases.\n",
      "Early in the pandemic, health care supply prices rose sharply amid supply disruptions and higher demand. Between 2019 and 2022, pharmaceutical prices rose 21% and supplies by 18%, according to McKinsey. Those costs are still higher than normal, though showing signs of slowing.\n",
      "In contrast, labor costs are still growing strongly and probably will outpace the overall inflation rate, analysts say.\n",
      "“Labor’s very significant because it has the potential to be persistent,” said Shubham Singhal, global leader of McKinsey’s Healthcare, Public Sector and Social Sector practice.\n",
      "He said he expects wages will continue to rise as the health care labor shortage worsens, while demand for services grows, partly the result of an aging population.\n",
      "Between 2019 and March 2022, a measure of hospital labor costs called the median labor expense per adjusted discharge rose 37% to $5,494 from $4,009, Kaufman Hall consulting firm said in a report in May.\n",
      "Will health care premiums go up?\n",
      "Consumers who buy their own insurance could start seeing steep premium increases next year.\n",
      "Across 72 insurers in 13 states and the District of Columbia in the Affordable Care Act Marketplaces, the median proposed premium increase next year is 10%, higher than in recent years, according to estimates by Peterson-Kaiser Health System Tracker.\n",
      "Health care prices are set at least a year ahead, creating a delay before wage increases and other costs related to broader inflation are fully incorporated into health care costs.\n",
      "Providers that have dealt with soaring costs in the past 18 months only recently are getting a chance to renegotiate payments and pass on some added costs to insurance companies or government entities.\n",
      "By 2024, all employers’ costs “will be crushing in full force,” Singhal said. “Much of that will fall to consumers because employers have premium sharing” with employees.\n",
      "“It’s a slow-moving train,” he said, but it’s coming.\n",
      "How do medical care costs affect inflation?\n",
      "Because health care, like rent, typically doesn’t see regular price surges, when its prices rise, economists consider this “sticky” or persistent inflation. They take a long time to rise and a long time to decline.\n",
      "Inflation could stay higher longer and lead to the Fed raising its short-term benchmark fed funds rate even higher to squash inflation. Most consumer rates follow the Fed’s benchmark rate higher, which makes borrowing more expensive and discouraging spending. Less spending means less demand, which cools inflation.\n",
      "How can the cost of health care be cut?\n",
      "Layoffs and increasing productivity can cut costs, McKinsey said.\n",
      "More than 25% of executives in a McKinsey survey said they think they might have to cut at least 10% of their workforce, mostly nonclinical employees like personal care aides, in the next six to 18 months, it said.\n",
      "Longer-term, Singhal said, the industry can accelerate value-based care, which ties payments to the quality of care provided. This contrasts with the dominant fee-for-service reimbursement, which pays providers for services delivered based on bill charges or annual fee schedules.\n",
      "Another strategy would be moving some hospital care to different sites.\n",
      "“Some surgeries can be done cheaper in an ambulatory surgery center instead of a hospital,” Singhal said. “Home care settings can also be the same or better quality at lower costs.”\n",

      "President Joe Biden laid out an ambitious goal at the White House’s first food conference in 50 years this week, committing $8 billion to address food insecurity with the aim of ending hunger in the U.S. by 2030.\n",
      "Globally, the path to tackling the growing issue remains much more dire, thanks to ongoing conflict and the ever-growing climate crisis.\n",
      "According to a new study from the United Nation’s World Food Program, the number of hunger hotspots have increased 10-fold in just five years. A record 970,000 people face catastrophic levels of hunger in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen.\n",
      "A man reacts at a fruit stall at the street market in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on August 25, 2022. (Photo by Miguel SCHINCARIOL/AFP)\n",
      "Food insecurity means an individual is not having a daily meal. Currently, 345 million people around the world are already approaching starvation, and those numbers will likely only worsen.\n",
      "“For 345 million people, that's because their food is being washed away by climate crises, like in Pakistan,\" International Rescue Coalition (IRC) CEO David Milibrand told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). \"Access to food is being blocked because of conflicts, like in places like Yemen. And also, because they can't afford to buy food, which is the situation in Afghanistan.”\n",
      "An unfolding food crisis\n",
      "Miiband’s warning comes as the world faces its largest food crisis in modern history, putting millions of people at risk.\n",
      "The unfolding humanitarian disaster has intensified this year, in part because of the fighting between Russia and Ukraine. The countries collectively account for 30% of globally traded wheat, 20% of maize, and 70% of sunflower supplies, while Russia remains a critical supplier of fertilizer. A shortage of exports from the two nations have pushed prices higher at a time when global energy prices have added to the cost pressures with sanctions limiting Russian oil and natural gas exports.\n",
      "Rice farmers in Indonesia are facing difficulties due to the continued increase in fertilizer prices following the Russia-Ukraine war. (Photo by Surya Fachrizal Aprianus/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n",
      "Miliband argued, though, that the outsized attention on Russia and Ukraine has masked a crisis that has been unraveling for years.\n",
      "Story continues\n",
      "“We shouldn't be mistaken for thinking that it's actually caused [the food crisis],” Miliband said. “The cause is more fundamental. And it's to do with the conflict, the climate crisis, and the maldistribution of resources.”\n",
      "Livelihoods 'literally being washed away'\n",
      "The impacts from climate change have particularly weighed heavily on the Global South, including the world’s poorest nations.\n",
      "Record monsoon rains killed more than 1500 people in Pakistan last month, and wiped out nearly 15% of Pakistan’s rice crop and 40% of its cotton crop, destroying livelihoods along with them. In Somalia, a country faced with its worst drought in 40 years, more than a million people have been displaced. With the prospect of a fifth straight year of drought, international organizations have warned about a famine breaking out if livestock and crops continue to die. The last famine that plagued the country in 2011 killed roughly a quarter million people.\n",
      "“What we see around the world is a structural crisis because so much of the agriculture is not climate resilient,” Milliband said. “The livelihoods that people depend on are literally being washed away. Their seeds are not able to be resistant to the kind of shift in temperatures that we're seeing.”\n",
      "Displaced women carry water pots as children take bath amid floodwater, while they take refuge in a camp, following rains and floods during the monsoon season in Sehwan, Pakistan, September 16, 2022. REUTERS/Akhtar Soomro\n",
      "'No doubt' the richest countries caused the climate crisis\n",
      "Soaring inflation driven largely by high energy costs and a surging dollar have only made the situation worse, putting the most indebted countries further in a financial hole and stripping funds away from humanitarian aid.\n",
      "In the face of those challenges, the calls for the world’s richest nations to increase their financial contributions have grown louder. Developing countries argue that the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters, including the U.S. and China, are responsible for the impacts of climate change that have disproportionately affected the poorest countries.\n",
      "At UN Climate Week in New York in September, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on developed nations to consider a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to provide the cash needed for climate-related disasters and mitigation efforts, saying “all polluters must pay.”\n",
      "“The truth is that it is rich countries that have created the climate crisis,\" Miliband said. \"There's no doubt about that. In terms of what we need to do, I'm afraid we have to do both. We have to mitigate future climate change by decarbonizing, changing, taking the carbon out of energy systems in the rich world … We also have to mitigate future danger by helping the poorest countries develop in a way that doesn't repeat our mistakes.”\n",

      "On September 28, LinkedIn released its Top Startups list, which is its self-described annual ranking of 50 emerging U.S. companies “gaining attention and recruiting top talent.” The professional networking site takes into consideration a variety of criteria based on its own data when coming up with the list: employment growth, engagement with the company and its employees, job interest and ability to attract talent from companies.\n",
      "Now, we often take these sorts of lists with a grain of salt. In this case, I was admittedly (and naturally) less interested in their overall rankings and more intrigued by which fintechs made the list — and why.\n",
      "Here’s what I found out: Seven fintech companies ranked in the top 50: Brex (No. 4), Ramp (No. 5), Gravy (No. 14), Esusu (No. 29), GPARENCY (No. 35), Deel (No. 43) and Masterworks (No. 47).\n",
      "Drilling down, I learned that among the seven fintech startups that made the list, there are 125+ open roles. An astounding 87% of those open roles are for remote positions.\n",
      "“A majority of fintech startups on this year's list deal in the realms of building and managing credit for businesses and consumers -- credit management is only becoming more important as interest rates rise and the economy slows, positioning these companies to play an even more relevant role in the lives of their users and customers,” LinkedIn business and finance editor at large Devin Banerjee told TechCrunch over email.\n",
      "Story continues\n",
      "LinkedIn went on to offer further insights on each of the companies and some examples of the roles they are looking to fill. The summaries preceding the open roles were drafted by LinkedIn using survey responses from the honoree companies.\n",
      "Brex\n",
      "Brex is 100% remote. The company is looking for customer-focused skills and asks candidates to tell them about “a time you learned something from a team member that changed your mind or widened your perspective.” Among the positions it is hiring for are Real-Time Analyst and Lifecycle Marketing Manager.\n",
      "Ramp\n",
      "The No. 1 skill Ramp is looking to hire for now is software engineering, as the company's main hiring priorities are for engineers and product managers, including entry-level and remote roles (the company is hybrid). Ramp doesn't require college degrees for all hires, and offers lots of \"learning opportunities, autonomy with a high level of ownership, and rapid advancement.\" Among the roles it is hiring for are Head of Data Science / Credit, Fraud, & Pricing and Partner Marketing & Enablement.\n",
      "Esusu\n",
      "Esusu is looking to hire those with engineering skills, and the company says critical thinking is the hardest skill to hire for. They’re “doubling down on folks we call justice capitalists — people who have a head for business and a heart for the world. These people fundamentally believe that doing good and doing well are by no means mutually exclusive.” Esusu advises candidates to “outreach with intent...It always grabs the attention of the recruiter when you reach out directly and have clearly researched the company and the role.” Among the positions it’s hiring for are Senior Cloud Infrastructure Engineer and Enterprise Account Executive.\n",
      "GPARENCY\n",
      "GPARENCY is looking to hire for sales, including entry-level roles, and says it is open to no experience — they’ll train new hires in the skills they need, and in company culture. For example, it’s looking for a Sales Executive.\n",
      "Deel\n",
      "Deel is looking to hire those with sales skills and says that candidates should be prepared to answer the interview question specifically to address this remote-first company: “What would you need to be successful working in a highly diverse, global work environment with colleagues sitting in nearly 80 countries and being fully remote?” From this question, the company looks to learn “how will the candidate handle the challenges of collaborating and communicating within a hyper-growth startup with 1300 team members.” Deel also says employee referrals are the best way a candidate can catch their attention. Among the positions it’s hiring for are Partnership Manager and Senior DevOps Engineer.\n",
      "Masterworks\n",
      "Masterworks says it is looking to hire product managers and engineers with startup experience, and asks candidates, “Where do you hope to be in 5 years?” The company says, “Though there is no right answer, we hope to see how driven the individual is, and how their personality comes through when considering their futures. We also like to hire individuals who we, as a company, can grow with.” The company is hybrid. Among the positions it’s hiring for are Principle Product Designer and CRM Specialist.\n",

      "Three letters we haven’t heard in a long time came up last week: IPO. TripActions is said to have filed confidentially to go public in the second quarter of next year at a $12 billion valuation. Last October, TripActions raised $275 million in a Series F “growth” funding round at a $7.25 billion valuation. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, TripActions was primarily known for merging many aspects of corporate trip booking — flights, hotels and rental cars — with expense tracking. But the Palo Alto–based company was among the startups that was hit very hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the global crisis resulted in its revenue dropping to $0, according to CEO and co-founder Ariel Cohen. But it has since leaned into its Liquid spend management offering, which puts it in direct competition with the likes of Brex and Ramp. Of course, the news had TC+ editor Alex Wilhelm and my Equity co-host super pumped. You can read his take here.\n",
      "When layoffs occur, we often get the employer's side of the story -- but not always that of the employees. For this article, Christine Hall and I talked extensively with several former Better.com employees. Warning: Many have said it was painful to read the detailed experiences of three former and one current employee. It took us weeks to write, as we wanted to be careful to protect our sources but yet still tell their stories.\n",
      "From Ivan Mehta: “Block, the company behind Square and Cash App, now supports Apple’s Tap to Pay for iPhone feature for merchants. Existing Square users or new businesses wanting to use Square can now use their iPhones to receive payments while using the fintech company’s financial management software.”\n",
      "From Manish Singh: Samsung has launched two credit cards in India, entering a crowded category that sees more than 50 companies fiercely compete for consumers’ attention in the world’s second largest internet market. The South Korean giant said it has partnered with the Mumbai-headquartered Axis Bank and global payments processor Visa to launch the cards, which it is calling the Samsung Axis Bank Signature Credit Card. Consumers buying Samsung’s products and services through either of the cards will get 10% cash back “round the year,” the company executives said at an event in New Delhi.\n",
      "From Romain Dillet: Meet Solvo, a new mobile app that wants to make it easier to invest in cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-related financial products. The two founders, Ayelen Denovitzer and Shailendra Sason, met while they were working for Revolut, in the crypto team more specifically. Earlier this year, Solvo raised a $3.5 million seed round from Index Ventures with CoinFund and FJ Labs also participating. Since then, the company has put together a small team of 10 people and started working on its iOS app.\n",
      "From Anita Ramaswamy: Investment app Public.com (Public), a Robinhood competitor that pivoted away from the contentious payment-for-order-flow (PFOF) revenue model, is expanding its offerings in a big way. The three-year-old company purchased Otis earlier this year to allow consumers to buy and trade fractional shares in alternative assets. Today, the company announced that it has integrated Otis’s offerings onto its own app, meaning its 3 million users can construct portfolios composed of both public stocks and alternative assets such as high-end trading cards and other collectibles.”\n",
      "From The Information: “Divvy Homes, a property tech startup backed by Andreessen Horowitz and Tiger Global Management, laid off about 12% of its staff Tuesday. The cuts affected about 40 people and are a reflection of how younger real estate firms are responding to rising mortgage rates that have battered the home-buying market…Divvy Homes buys homes in the U.S. and rents them to people who don’t have the credit history or savings to buy, but hope to eventually purchase the homes. The firm, valued last year at about $2 billion, has raised over $500 million in equity.” I covered the company’s February 2021 $110 million Series C raise here.\n",
      "From Insider: “Hopscotch, a B2B payments fintech, aims to be a Venmo-like payment tool for businesses. Its 22-year-old founder was inspired after paying vendors for his apparel brand with paper checks. The company’s new product, Hopscotch Flow, is the first step towards monetizing the platform.” Via email, founder Reed Switzer told me: “Too often, B2B invoicing/bill-pay solutions are self-serving, with fragmented features, and offer few tools to help elevate hard-working modern freelancer/small business owners. We’re meeting a need. Even as small businesses struggled to survive in 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that business applications were up a record-breaking 43.3% over the same period in 2019 — small businesses are thriving and need support. We’re trying to break barriers — I’m a 22-year-old black founder in B2B payments (likely the youngest in the space) and my lead investors are also PoC (Peter Boyce II + Simeon Iheagwam).”\n",
      "Chase and DoorDash announced plans to launch the “first-ever” DoorDash credit card, with Mastercard as the exclusive payments network for the new card. The companies said that the DoorDash Rewards Mastercard “will allow cardmembers to unlock benefits and earn rewards on purchases both on and off the DoorDash platform.” Instacart recently teamed up with Chase as well, as noted by my colleague Kyle Wiggers, who pointed out that it seems “Chase is leaning heavily into co-branding these days.”\n",
      "Rho last week announced Prime Treasury, “a tailored treasury management service integrated with the Rho platform.” Via email, a company spokesperson told me: “The Fed is expected to hike interest rates this week, putting more pressure on CFOs and other business leaders to protect their cash reserves from the effects of inflation…Unless you are a Fortune 500 company, you likely don’t have access to a sophisticated treasury management team that can develop and execute a unique investment policy to combat inflation.” The move, according to the company, “bolsters Rho’s support for growth-stage companies and the middle market…As interest rates continue to rise and alternative, risky assets like crypto continue to fall, the case for high-grade assets, including US Treasuries, strengthens.” Read more on the company’s blog post here.\n",
      "Last week, Secfi launched Secfi Wealth — a fully independent RIA — to provide startup founders and employees with financial planning and investment management. A company spokesperson told me via email: “Wealth Management services at traditional financial institutions usually require $1M + of liquid assets which is not a reality for most startup employees even though they have huge financial decisions to make starting with their equity. Secfi believes that the big firms have this backward as they only advise clients after a major exit event, but when it comes to equity, the reality is that the impact that can be made pre-exit is magnitudes greater than what can be done for someone after an exit. Secfi wants to help startup employees today in the pre-wealth phase so they are better set up for life events and hopefully a life-changing exit down the road.”\n",
      "From Accounting Today: “Routable, a business payments platform, has added optical character recognition to automatically scan invoices to create payables and process hundreds of invoices at once. Routable says the new capability can save up to three minutes per invoice. For businesses processing 10,000 invoices per month, this can add up to 167 hours per week, saving an equivalent of $168,000 per year.” I covered the company’s $30 million Series B led by the Altman Brothers in April of 2021.\n",
      "Virtual payment card company Lithic has launched Lithic Send, which CEO Bo Jiang describes in a blog post as “a new suite of products designed for companies that need a faster, more flexible way to build out card disbursement programs.” A spokesperson told me: “Creating a card disbursement program traditionally takes months of development because of integrating with multiple vendors, mapping card transaction lifecycle to a ledger, and creating custom logic. With Lithic Send you can now do this in weeks or even days.” The company, which used to go by the name Privacy.com, raised $43 million in May of 2021, which I covered here.\n",

      "RSM Canada (CNW Group/RSM Canada)\n",
      "As governments and industries around the world grapple with inflation, rising costs and a breadth of other economic hurdles, the latest edition of The Real Economy, Canada examines how Canada's economy is faring at the moment, and what key issues and opportunities businesses need to be aware of in the coming months.\n",
      "Key findings in this quarter's report include:\n",
      "Recession talk is pre-mature, though economic headwinds are having an impact.\n",
      "The Canadian economy has bounced back strong from pandemic lockdowns, as pent-up consumer demand and government support have fueled GDP growth in every quarter since the third quarter of 2021.\n",
      "However, inflation and a rising unemployment rate, combined with persistent labour and housing shortages present elevated risk that Canada could enter a recession early next year.\n",
      "Inflation will take a while to slow despite potential summer peak, as the war in Ukraine grinds on and the labour market remains tight.\n",

      "Story continues\n",
      "Canada will need to accelerate its immigration goals to address long-term labour and productivity problems.\n",
      "Declining labour force participation rates, an aging population and declining fertility rates mean that Canada must rely on immigration – rather than natural growth – to replenish the labour pool.\n",
      "Canadian policymakers are aiming to bring in more than 400,000 immigrants per year between 2022 and 2024 following the growth immigration has spurred in the millennial and Gen-Z workforce.\n",
      "Immigrants are also shown to increase productivity rates, something Canada cannot afford to ignore as labour productivity in Canada might fall to last among countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in just a decade.\n",
      "However, Canada must streamline the accreditation process if it wishes for skilled immigrants to fill the labour gaps that are most glaring, such as in the health care industry.\n",
      "Higher interest rates have cooled Canada's housing market, but demand remains high.\n",
      "The construction industry has been hit hard by rising interest rates and the resulting slowdown now threatens to make Canada's housing shortage more acute.\n",
      "Rising rates, combined with inflation, threaten to put a lid on housing construction for the foreseeable future, potentially further worsening the housing affordability crisis in Canada.\n",
      "While most industries gained jobs, the construction industry lost over 23,000 in April and June, despite the red-hot labour market.\n",
      "However, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's new mortgage loan insurance program is giving developers access to mortgages with more favourable financial terms, which incentivizes them to build more affordable housing and energy efficient housing projects.\n",
      "Canada will stand to benefit from the United States' Inflation Reduction Act and green energy transition.\n",
      "This legislative and financial commitment by Canada's closest trading partner provides Canadian companies with some certainty as to where they can hang their hats from an economic development perspective.\n",
      "Canada's mining and manufacturing sectors will be well-positioned to benefit as they provide the products and minerals necessary to facilitate the clean energy transition, particularly when it comes to electric vehicle development.\n",
      "Though Canada's climate change strategy has been fairly robust, the IRA and the resulting opportunities will help provide a clearer picture of how to economically build and scale clean energy industries.\n",
      "Canada's industrial sector is reaping the benefits of strong global demand.\n",
      "The Prairie provinces have been leading the economy because of growing global demand for energy and rare metals.\n",
      "Canadian industrial production grew over five per cent year-over-year in the second quarter, well above the pre-pandemic level, and is expected to end the year on a high note.\n",
      "However, industrial production may diminish in subsequent months as global markets anticipate a recession and consumer demand slows.\n",
      "\"Despite a robust recovery from the lockdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic, Canadian economic growth will continue slowing down due to persistent inflation and an historically tight labour market,\" says Tu Nguyen, economist and ESG director with RSM Canada. \"But the real long-term challenge will be the labour shortage, with declining worker participation hitting the health care, hospitality and food services industries particularly hard.\"\n",
      "Nguyen continues: \"There's also a fundamental shift in the demographic of Canada's labour force, causing policymakers to explore ambitious immigration goals to address the labour gap. But government, industry associations and organizations will actually need to go further and streamline the accreditation process so that workers educated abroad can fill much-needed roles in Canada. Only then can Canada hope to have more meaningful growth in labour supply and productivity.\"\n",

      "Did Verizon just raise prices? Administrative fee increase is another price hike\n",
      "Verizon has spent much of this year reworking its unlimited-data offerings. Its September introduction of a plan that throws in Apple’s Apple One bundle of services brought it to six such plans. But it quietly rolled out a more meaningful change to its rates in July.\n",
      "That’s when it increased the “Administrative and Telco Recovery Charge” applied across its plans from $1.95 to $3.30, just over a 69% increase. The review from many Verizon customers since then, as seen in such forums as Reddit’s r/verizon: not nice.\n",
      "As one reader noted in a message, that extra $1.35 on people’s bills will add up at scale – Verizon reported in July that it has 91.5 million subscribers. He also objected to how this surcharge was only itemized on a PDF of his bill, sharing a screenshot of one recent statement that showed a total of $7.85 in taxes and surcharges.\n",
      "“They hope that consumers don’t realize it, because consumers look at the headline price,” said Roger Entner, founder and lead analyst at Recon Analytics. “They hope that it’s an itch point, not a pain point for customers.”\n",
      "Apple releases AirPods Pro '2.': Our review: New earbuds are a perfect fit for iPhone users.\n",
      "Were people eating NyQuil chicken?: Viral challenge was the latest internet lore\n",
      "A Verizon publicist declined to speak on the record about this, but the not-for-attribution response she offered matched almost exactly with the language of a customer-support posting in a thread on Verizon’s own forum: “Verizon reviews the Administrative and Telco Recovery Charge from time to time and makes adjustments to recover some of the administrative and telco expenses and costs of complying with regulatory requirements we incur to provide service.”\n",
      "Not every Verizon representative, however, seems to have gotten the same memo about explaining what can look like telecom’s sneaky answer to the “shrinkflation” inflation response of some grocery vendors. That Verizon forum thread includes a post from a user complaining that two different Verizon support reps “told me that this is a state tax and that Verizon has no control over it.”\n",
      "Story continues\n",
      "Verizon has quietly rolled out an administrative fee that is a price hike for consumers.\n",
      "Verizon is not the only wireless carrier to fine-print its way to fatter subscription revenue. AT&T has long charged a $1.99 “Administrative Fee” on top of its “Cost Recovery Fees” – although that surcharge drew a class-action lawsuit alleging it violated California law that the carrier recently proposed to settle with payments of $15 to $30 for class members. T-Mobile, in turn, levies a “Regulatory Programs & Telco Recovery Fee” that it bumped in February from $3.18 to $3.49.\n",
      "But T-Mobile’s Magenta and Magenta Max unlimited-data plans, the ones it markets most heavily, include all taxes and fees in their advertised rates. The same all-inclusive pricing applies at Visible, the Verizon-owned service that resells its network at a much lower price, subject to a strict 5 Mbps speed limit on mobile hotspot use.\n",
      "Noting that Verizon has reported subscriber losses for two quarters in a row, Entner questioned the wisdom of trying to launder a rate hike through an add-on fee with a dubious rationale: “It is driving some customers to leave.”\n",

      "The home price correction intensifies-what to expect from the U.S. housing market in 2023\n",
      "Anytime the Federal Reserve moves into inflation-fighting mode, the U.S. housing market is going to be vulnerable. But when those interest rate hikes come after U.S. home prices soared 43% in just over two years, the consequences will be even more pronounced.\n",
      "That, of course, is what we’re seeing now. Despite favorable demographics and tight inventory levels, pressured affordability—spiked mortgage rates coupled with frothy home prices—is beginning to push home prices lower. In fact, this week we learned that U.S. home prices as measured by the Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index posted its first month-over-month decline since 2012.\n",
      "Across the country, the U.S. housing market—which got priced to 3% mortgage rates during the Pandemic Housing Boom—is working toward equilibrium in the face of 6% mortgage rates. But we’re still in the early innings. And the ongoing home price correction still hasn’t hit every market: Between May and August, home values in San Jose fell 10.6% while home values grew 2% in Orlando.\n",
      "To better understand where the U.S. housing downturn heads next—and if the home price correction will soon hit more markets—Fortune reached out to Zonda chief economist Ali Wolf. When she’s not traveling around the country speaking to homebuilders, she’s advising the White House on housing matters.\n",
      "Below is Fortune‘s Q&A with Ali Wolf.\n",
      "Fortune: As the data rolls in, it’s pretty clear that home prices are falling in many markets across the country. In some places it’s fairly sharp. Do you expect home price declines to continue into 2023?\n",
      "Wolf: We haven’t seen home prices drop universally across the country, but there are some markets where home prices have started to come down and we expect to see that in more metros across the country in the next handful of months. Corrections in home prices can be expected in 2023 as long as interest rates remain elevated and consumer demand remains slow.\n",
      "What types of markets are the most vulnerable?\n",
      "The markets that are the most vulnerable include: 1) Those where home prices rose sharply because of hybrid work, like Boise, Las Vegas, and Denver. 2) Markets that don’t have a local employment base to support the higher home prices (put another way, markets where home prices and incomes are out of whack), like Nashville and parts of Florida. 3) Markets where housing inventory has risen rapidly, like Phoenix and Austin.\n",
      "Why are markets like Austin, Boise, and Phoenix shifting so fast?\n",
      "The housing booms seen in markets like Austin, Boise, and Phoenix were among the earliest in the nation and the sharpest. The record-low mortgage interest rates combined with lifestyle changes brought on by the pandemic, including work from home and increased relocations, drove a dramatic uptick in housing demand and supply could not keep pace.\n",
      "Those relocating from places like California and Washington were able to tap home equity from a sale in the higher cost market and put those funds towards buying a new home in these relatively more affordable markets. Relocation buyers found these markets very affordable compared to where they were moving from at the detriment of local buyers.\n",
      "There was a belief in these markets that the supply and demand imbalance was so severe and so long standing that the markets could never get overheated. Buyers, frantic to secure a home, were willing to pay almost any price to secure a home. Investors and flippers considered these markets ripe for opportunities. This mentality contributed to the massive run-up in home prices.\n",
      "As interest rates rose in early 2022, however, reality started to kick in. Home price appreciation was slowing and not every home that was listed was selling for above the list price within a day of coming online. The demand for housing slowed just as some of the new homes under construction started coming online and existing home inventory rapidly increased as sellers tried to time what they believed to be the top of the market.\n",
      "How do you expect mortgage rates near 7% to impact the housing market? We were already correcting with 5% mortgage rates. Should we expect things to intensify with 6.5%-7% rates?\n",
      "Housing affordability is driven by many factors, but the two key inputs are home prices and mortgage rates. We just lived through a unique period in American history where rising home prices were offset by record-low interest rates. The cheap financing helped keep the monthly mortgage payment in check.\n",
      "Interest rates have risen dramatically since the start of the year, though, putting a strain on housing affordability. Buyers were already starting to get priced out of the market when interest rates moved from 3% to 4% and every 100-basis point increase has continued to price millions of Americans out of homeownership.\n",
      "If mortgage rates remain elevated for an extended period, we expect that housing demand will remain soft, new home construction will be restricted, and home prices will need to adjust downward across the country.\n",

      "How Bad will it Get?\n",
      "00:00\n",
      "So let me start with you David. The most basic question how bad is it going to get. How bad is it going to get. Well thank goodness it's Friday. The weekend should be a reprieve. Tough day. Tough week. Tough year. The S & P 500 is down 25 26 percent from its all time high. This is this is a bear market. I find myself thinking about the 1970s lately. And I think something to keep in mind is that the 1982 bear market when the Fed was fighting inflation aggressively back then the S & P fell 27 28 percent but in 1974 the S & P fell 48 percent. So I think a key question is is this the beginning of a high inflationary period. Where are we near the end of a high inflationary period. If you think we're near the end of a high inflationary period the worst is largely behind and the market shouldn't go too much further down. But that's the key question. I'm not feeling much better. What do you think. All right. I'm going to try to make you feel a little bit good. So look we think that the market is set to stage a major major battle at the 30 500 level. And the reason for that is if you look back over the course of recessions into the 30s a median recessionary draw down is about 27 percent. And so we'll get there when we're around thirty five hundred on the S & P. And I still as I talk to investors I think many are still in the mild kind of quick or shallow camp. But do think there's going to be a sluggish growth backdrop. Afterwards I think people are not really looking for anything major like what we had in the financial crisis. So I think that at least we've got that at our back. I will tell you if you think about kind of where investors heads are at something else that makes me feel a little bit better is I'm not sensing a ton of panic definitely alarm. But the big question of the day is what do higher rates for longer mean for valuation multiples. And that's a very constructive conversation. And we've done some work suggesting that we're probably getting pretty close. If he hit that 30 500 level on the S & P to the same kind of multiple contraction you saw back in the 70s over the course of the entire decade. I want to come back to earnings. But before that we just heard from Lori short and shallow. I think you said I think she's referring to a recession. You're projecting recession. And I guess my question really is normally if you have a recession we turn our heads and look at the Fed and say OK please cut rates. Do we have much room to really deal the recession. If and when it comes we're expecting a short and shallow recession but we're a bit concerned that the troughs might linger well into 2023. We're not expecting a V shaped recovery after the small recession. We think it can be slow real growth afterward. The trouble here is that the Fed can't rescue us because of the inflation problem and they can't attempt to rescue the equity market or even the economy broadly until they're confident that the inflation battle's been won. So I think what you people know it's pretty clear at this stage the Fed is committed to fighting inflation and they've decided they're willing to risk a small moderate recession tolerate one to make sure that this inflation boost is slowing. So if we're talking about equities just for a moment you've got at least two things going on. One is valuations. And what we're expecting in the higher discount rate affects that. Also earnings earnings. What are you expecting on earnings at this stage. We're expecting earnings for 2022 to be two hundred twenty five dollars. I think at this stage you should not expect any growth. It should be flat in 2023. But every day that goes by with the shocks that we're experiencing higher interest rates the super strong dollar collapses and other currencies around the world even oil prices have come down a lot. And we are beginning to see a lot of companies come out and say things are slowing. So the earnings risk is mounting. What about earnings. When we saw FedEx we saw Apple. We've seen a lot of earnings warnings out now. So we're actually pretty far below consensus where it to 18 for this year versus to eleven last year. And then we're actually at 212 for next year on S & P earnings. So we think this is going to be pretty similar to 2015 2016 where earnings basically go nowhere for a couple of years. And I do think companies are much more resilient in terms of managing their business models than they have been in the past. There's a lot more flexibility a lot more ways to suck out costs a lot of more ways to manage through supply chains are improving. But one thing we've been telling investors is as inflation moderates. That takes a bite out of earnings because it takes a bite out of revenues. So that's a big headwind. We've got next year. So Lori can companies maybe resilient consumers how resilient are they. And particularly tie that into unemployment. Because if we do go this direction what kind of unemployment are we facing. So look I think consumers are headed into some headwinds here and we're starting to see trade down impact. You're seeing a lot of those references on their earnings calls. We're also starting to see a lot of impacts among lower end consumers higher and has been holding them much better. But we do think the consumer is going to take some knocks. One of the things that gives me comfort is when I talked to my bank analyst for example they told me the starting points on various credit metrics are looking much better than they have heading into past recessions. So we think a lot of the consumer trends are going to head in the wrong direction but they're not going to necessarily be hit as bad as they have in past downturns. Just because balance sheets have been cleaned up pretty strongly over the past few years then we're thinking similarly that the consumer is having a tough time that got hit by this high inflation. They see the high. Rates affecting the housing market but this small recession should be marked by still an inflationary environment not deflation and we think the labor market will be relatively OK. They will suffer some knocks but we don't think unemployment goes up any more than 1 percent. We're usually goes up 3 4 or 5 percent during a recession. So if it's still inflation not deflation and the labor market holds in there largely because supply is tight then credit conditions credit costs. They should be benign. That should help the banks get through this very well and that should help investors in investing credit. 2023 should be a better year for fixed income investing. So relatively benign. What we saw in the United Kingdom this week was not benign. There was a real break in the market dislocation. Do we have to anticipate something similar that the United States. The short answer is no. However what's happening in the UK is a shot across our bough one that I hope our policymakers take very seriously. And that comes down to when you're fighting inflation and your economy is suffering supply side shocks and other pressures. It is difficult to support the economy with monetary policy. They're hiking rates the BSE and it's difficult to support the economy with fiscal policy. They also have deficits. So the United States needs to be a lot more mindful about its deficits whether it's tax cuts or spending. These deficits need to be watched in this time of rising interest rates. So Larry one more attempt to put this. Our broader perspective on a great financial crisis is what we're all afraid of. Right. We're in better shape going in to this whatever this is than we were that time right. I think we are. I mean we again go back to our banks analysts who spend time scrutinizing the balance sheets of the big major banks. And we think the plumbing is in much much better shape. I mean the way I put it is the stress tests do appear to have worked. That's one of the reasons why banks haven't really been able to grow in recent years. But it is also one thing that I think is going to really be an asset to the financial markets in coming years. And we're overweight the banks we've been adding this week. But on the banks specifically that's great. And the banks which is up to all the right regulation. What about the part that's not subject to recovery. What about the the shadow banks. What about the private credit issues. We don't necessarily know what's going on there. Well there's some debt in the system because debt was so cheap and readily available for the past 10 20 years. But the banks just as Laurie said were confident that their balance sheets are strong. Higher interest rates they should make higher net interest margins provided their credit costs don't surge. But a resilient labor market. Home prices may come down a little bit but as long as they don't collapse people keep paying their mortgages particularly they're locked in the low rates from before.\n",
