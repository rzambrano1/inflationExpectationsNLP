    "**Assessing the Model**\n",
    "To assess our new model, we’ll first infer new vectors for each document of the training corpus, compare the inferred vectors with the training corpus, and then returning the rank of the document based on self-similarity. Basically, we’re pretending as if the training corpus is some new unseen data and then seeing how they compare with the trained model. The expectation is that we’ve likely overfit our model (i.e., all of the ranks will be less than 2) and so we should be able to find similar documents very easily. Additionally, we’ll keep track of the second ranks for a comparison of less similar documents."

      "labeledArticle(articleID=35, label='Inflation will fade away', body='the personal consumption expenditures index showed prices increased 55 percent last month as consumer spending pulled back  the federal reserves preferred inflation measure is showing signs of moderating after months of rapid price increases and a closely watched gauge of consumer spending slowed last month a sign that the economy may have less steam as it heads into 2023  the personal consumption expenditures price index climbed 55 percent in november from a year earlier a slowdown from 61 percent in the previous reading stripped of food and fuel costs which jump around a socalled core price measure climbed 47 percent down from 5 percent in the previous reading both figures were roughly in line with economist forecasts  although inflation is slowing it still has a long way to go to return to a more normal pace the fed has raised interest rates at the fastest clip in decades this year as it has tried to temper consumer and business demand hoping to force price increases to moderate those rate increases are now trickling through the economy slowing the housing market cooling demand for new business investments and potentially weakening the labor market  but it remains to be seen just how much the feds policy changes will slow down the overall economy so far spending and hiring have both been relatively resilient  which has left policymakers and economists alike closely watching each new data report like the one released friday for any hint at how consumers are faring  reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of belowtrend growth and some softening of labor market conditions jerome h powell the fed chair said at his final news conference of the year  the economic figures on friday showed that consumer spending slowed in november climbing just 01 percent from october less than the 02 percent economists had forecast but spending in october was revised up slightly and posted a robust 09 percent increase  evidence that it is still hard to get a handle on the trajectory for consumption  those figures do not account for inflation adjusted for price increases spending did not grow at all  and under the surface the data pointed to a continued shift in what americans are buying spending on services continues to grow even as people buy fewer goods like furniture and clothing  even if they are not yet conclusive signs of cooling consumer demand are likely to be welcome news for officials at the fed the economy slowed notably in 2022 from its rapid expansion in 2021 but policymakers at the fed believe that it needs to remain weaker than usual through next year to get inflation back down to the 2 percent that they shoot for on average over time  thats because rapid inflation  which began as pandemicinduced supply shortages collided with strong consumer demand  has become more stubborn over time it now spans a variety of service categories from dentist visits to meals out at restaurants those sorts of price gains tend to be fueled by increasing wages and can take time to stamp out  the lowhanging fruit is working out energy components and supply chain issues are coming off priya misra head of global rates strategy at td securities said of the recent cooling in inflation but services inflation she said is likely to be a more intractable problem  they still talk about inflation as public enemy no 1 but the narrative around inflation has moved to wages and the labor market ms misra said  the fed is hoping that weighing down the broader economy will help to bring demand for workers back into balance with the supply of available employees as conditions moderate policymakers think pay gains will slow and inflation will be able to return fully to normal paving the way for more sustainable growth  looking ahead we expect a deceleration in household spending as the fed hikes rates further in 2023 rubeela farooqi chief us economist at high frequency economics wrote in response to the data released on friday  but nailing that landing is sure to be difficult officials will have to guess just how high interest rates need to go and how long they need to stay there  to slow the economy and price increases sufficiently that is an inexact science and there is a risk that officials will cause a painful recession as they try to slow down the economy  as a result fed officials this month began to move rates at a more gradual pace and have hinted that they couldstop raising them altogether at some point in 2023 that will give them time to see how their policy changes so far are playing through the economy  its now not so important how fast we go its far more important to think what is the ultimate level mr powell said at his latest news conference and then its  at a certain point the question will become how long do we remain restrictive  among other challenges it is tough to guess how american consumers who drive about 70 percent of the economy will behave next year they are eking out income gains even counting for inflation in recent months and they are still sitting on savings amassed during the pandemic that could help to keep them shopping into 2023  but at the same time many families have been drawing down their extra funds and the nations savings rate how much people tuck away out of their disposable income  has dipped to low levels it is unclear how long people will be willing to spend out of their nest eggs before they begin to meaningfully pull back  the white house for its part has been welcoming any sign that the economy remains resilient at price increases fade  there will be more ups and downs in the year ahead but we are making progress building an economy from

      "Test Document (0): «stubbornly high inflation is finally easing as supply chain disruptions fade and interest rate sat year highs put the brakes on demand now federal reserve officials have voiced unease that prices could reaccelerate because labor markets are so tight at issue is what the right way to forecast inflation bottomup analysis of recent readings on prices and wages that puts more weight on pandemicdriven idiosyncrasies or traditional topdown analysis of how far the economy is operating above or below its normal capacity some inside the fed including its influential staff put more weight on the latter which would argue for tighter policy for longer others prefer the former which could argue for milder approach the fed is likely to raise interest rates on wednesday by quarter percentage point to range between and slowing increases for the second consecutive meeting that would give officials more time to study the effects of earlier rate rises they are likely to debate how long to continue raising rates and how long to hold them at that higher level the work horse models that fed and privatesector economists use to predict inflation compare the country total demand for goods and services with their total supply as represented by the output gap the difference between actual gross domestic product and potential gdp based on available capital and labor they also lean on the phillips curve which predicts that wages and prices rise faster when unemployment falls below some natural sustainable level estimating these variables is difficult even in normal times let alone after pandemic and amid the war in ukraine the natural unemployment rate can only be inferred from the behavior of prices and wages decade ago fed officials put it between and and then revised it lower to around as actual unemployment fell below without much acceleration in wages their projections for interest rates and inflation in december suggest they think the natural rate has temporarily shifted up to around said aneta markowska chief economist at jefferies llc with unemployment now at that suggests the labor market is too tight and likely to keep wage pressure high minutes of last month fed meeting show the central bank staff economists think the natural rate might decline slowly because jobmatching will remain inefficient suggesting price pressures could persist for longer than previously thought the staff also revised down estimates of potential output because of tepid labor force growth leaving actual output even further above its sustainable level staff saw this output gap persisting until the end of year longer than they projected just few weeks earlier it was significant move said riccardo trezzi former fed economist who runs an firm in geneva the staff is telling the committee you cannot give upnow because if you do we will remain significantly above inflation in the medium term still fed officials are wary of pinning too much on output gaps and phillips curves since an overheated labor market is likely to show up first in wages many officials see those as better proxy of underlying inflation pressure wages reveal what employers think they can recover via prices or productivity and what workers expect given their own cost of living if wages continue to grow at their recent rate of to that would keep inflation well above the fed inflation goal assuming productivity grows around to year this is why fed policy makers last month revised higher their projections for inflation this year higher wage growth boosts aggregate incomes providing spending power that can sustain higher prices officials worry tight labor markets could allow paychecks to rise in lockstep with prices as occurred during the since last month meeting there has been more evidence that labor demand may have softened including declines in temporary hiring and hours worked if wage growth slipped to getting inflation to would be easier boost in the supply of workers would help allay wage worries jonathan pingle chief useconomist at ubs believes labor shortages could ease as immigration rebounds last month the census bureau published estimates showing net immigration for the months through june topped million for the first time since fed officials closely watch the employmentcost index because it is the most comprehensive measure of wage growth the fourthquarter figure is to be released tuesday inflation as measured by the month change in the price index of expenditures excluding food and energy fell to last month from in september though still above the fed goal it moderated in the last three months to an annualized inflation is slowing because prices of goods are falling large increases in housing costs have slowed but haven filtered through to official price gauges yet as result fed chair jerome powell and several colleagues shifted attention recently toward narrower subset of laborintensive services by excluding prices for food energy shelter and goods mr powell has said prices in this category which rose in december from year earlier offer the best gauge of higher wage costs passing through to consumer prices in speech this month fed vice chair lael brainard offered more optimistic reassessment of that view highlighting reasons the links between wages and prices for nonhousing service prices might be weaker she pointed to the prospect for price increases to moderate if they reflect the ripple effects of recent global dislocations that are now reversing as opposed to the growth in wages prices of restaurant meals car insurance and airfares for example could ease if they have been primarily caused by the passthrough of higher food prices car prices and fuel prices respectively if wage pressures are moderating on their own it becomes harder to tell story where you re going to be really worried about wageprice spiral developing said mr pingle of ubs john roberts former fed economist said he sees some scope for declining nonwage costs to ease pressure on services inflation but in the medium term have to lean on powell argument here he said if wage growth stays as high as it has been they will still have an inflation problem»\n",

      "MEDIAN (21, 0.3986176550388336): «investors are grappling anew with whether improving economic data will finally translate to higher inflation after month long decline in governmentbond prices carried the yield on the year us treasury note tuesday to close above for the first time since march for years bond buyers and economists have debated whether tentative signs of rising prices will take hold sparking sporadic moves in the bond market so far inflation has remained stubbornly low even as the economy rebounds still many investors believe inflation is bound to pick up if the labor market continues to improve and some market indicators suggest inflation expectations have been climbing in recent weeks reflecting better economic data rising energy prices and the passage of sweeping tax cuts which many think could provide further boost to the economy rising inflation is major threat to government bond investors because it chips away at the purchasing power of their fixed interest payments the year treasury yield is watched particularly closely because it is bedrock of global finance influencing borrowing rates for consumers businesses and state and local governments ultralow treasury yields in recent years have helped boost stocks by making them look more attractive to yieldseeking investors while spurring record bond issuance by us companies there lot of optimism globally for the prospects for growth and inflation said brendan murphy standish mellon senior portfolio manager economies are growing in asynchronous fashion they re also growing above trend as prices of treasurys have fallen the yield has increased the yield on the benchmark year treasury note settled at tuesday compared with monday the surge above marks the latest milestone in the year yield recent rise after it spent much of stuck in range between and as investors grew confident that inflation would remain muted analysts attributed some of tuesday selling to an announcement from the bank of japan that it would trim purchases of longterm japanese government bonds move that bolstered investors concerns that central banks around the world are preparing to step away from postcrisis policies that have kept yields near historic lows the boj decision which some analysts described as minor on its own is significant because foreign investors hold of outstanding treasurys and because analysts see the bond purchases by the european central bank and the boj as factors driving overseas demand for higheryielding treasury debt foreign investors increased their holdings of us government debt by through october on track to post their first annual increase since according to the latest available data from the treasury department investors had expected yields to rise in buoyed by surge of growth and inflation sparked by trump administration priorities such as tax cuts regulatory rollbacks and infrastructure spending instead inflation lagged behind other economic data causing investors to grow pessimistic that it would break out of its rut one indication of how those views have changed recently the year inflation breakeven rate which reflects the yield premium on the year us treasury note over the comparable treasury security topped last week for the first time in more than nine months according to thomson reuters it settled tuesday at its highest level since march investors in protected securities or tips receive small yield as well as an increase to their principal equal to the annual change in the consumerprice index the breakeven rate is the annual increase in cpi necessary for tips investor to earn the same income as an investor holding the regular treasury note of the same maturity as result year breakeven rate is roughly equivalent to the annual inflation rate bond investors expect over the next years the rising breakeven rate is an indication that people are pretty concerned about inflation said gary pollack head of fixedincome trading at deutsche bank private wealth management mr pollack said he has been selling year treasurys over the past month and holding the proceeds in cash as he looks for better investment opportunities the recent shift in investors inflation expectations will face test friday when the labor department releases cpi data for december the cpi increased in november from year earlier however the fed preferred inflation gauge the price index for expenditures rose just on headline basis and when excluding volatile food and energy costs that is below the central bank annual target if we get strong cpi number on friday then think certainly the market will be justified in moving past the mark said gennadiy goldberg senior us rates strategist at td securities yet if the data disappoints think this will all come back very quickly he added while rising year yield typically signals investors growing confidence in the economy some analysts said sudden climb higher could reduce the appeal of riskier assets such as stocks which have started with string of records and milestones higher inflation could also dent stock prices by threatening the value of corporate earnings said james paulsen chief investment strategist at the leuthold group several analysts noted that yields remain low by historical standards and treasurys have sold off several times over the past months only to rally again the last time the year yield closed above on march investors were concerned that the fed would quicken the pace of its interestrate increases but those fears quickly abated in less than week the yield was back to below and it dipped under in early september»\n",

      "LEAST (23, -0.09851035475730896): «here is potted history of recent economic policy and inflation in the central banks created vast amounts of money through their qe schemes while governments enacted fiscal austerity inflation in the rich world was mostly too low undershooting central banks targets then the pandemic struck there was plenty more qe but the truly novel economic policy was the trn in fiscal stimulus implemented worldwide equivalent to of global gdp the result was high inflation the rich country that has splurged the most america has had the most inflation with consumer prices rising at anannual pace of the federal reserve on december th was forced to acknowledge that inflation had become big threat at first glance this apparent supremacy of fiscal policy is awkward for fans of milton friedman view that inflation is always and everywhere monetary phenomenon central banks not governments are charged with hitting inflation targets but does the experience of the pandemic show that inflation is really fiscal one way in which fiscal stimulus boosts inflation is by strengthening households and firms balancesheets making them more likely to spend suppose the government raises cash from investors who receive bonds in exchange then it hands out the money to households returning it into circulation netting off it is as if the government has just given out new bonds whether those bonds truly constitute new wealth for the private sector is the subject of an old theoretical debate when the government runs up debts the public could also expect to pay higher taxes in the future liability that off sets their newly created assets yet in reality it is clear that fiscal stimulus leads to more spending now introduce new step into the thought experiment the central bank implementing qe creates new money with which it buys the bonds that the government has given out so when you net everything off the government is not giving out bonds it is giving out cash this is not far off the policy mix during the pandemic the tsunami of fiscal stimulus was accompanied by bondbuying of almost equal magnitude central banks in america britain the euro zone and japan have together bought more than trn in assets the result has been surge in deposits at commercial banks in america they have risen from around trn in early to around trn today as early as the spring of some monetarist economists such as tim congdon of the university of buckingham pointed to surging measures of broad money which includes bank deposits and warned of inflation to follow so far so friedmanite but which leg of the policy matters more the fiscal stimulus which boosted aggregate household wealth or qe which ensured the infusion was of cash and not of bonds there is probably something special about infusing households balancesheets with cash says chris marsh of exante data research firm he has suggested that rediscovery of monetarism could be in the offing after the pandemic other economists however argue that qe is mostly ineffective except in periods of acute financial stress such as the dash for cash in spring suppose that once that crisis had passed central banks had shrunk their balancesheets quickly but had still promised to keep interest rates at zero for long time it seems likely that america enormous fiscal stimulus would by boosting household wealth still have driven up spending and prices yet believing in the impotence of qe compared with fiscal stimulus is in fact consistent with monetarism if you expand the definition of money distinguishing the electronic money created by central banks from debt securities issued by governments is increasingly difficult this is partly because when interest rates are closeto zero they are closer substitutes it is also because most central banks now pay interest on the electronic money they create even if rates were to rise socalled interest on reserves would still leave electronic money looking bit like public debt the reverse is also true investors value government debt especially america for its liquidity meaning they are willing to hold it at lower interest rate than other investments much like the public is willing to accept low yield on bank deposits as result it seems more accurate to view the national debt less as form of debt and more as form of money in circulation wrote david andolfatto of the federal reserve bank of st louis in december he also warned americans to prepare themselves for temporary burst of inflation in light of the oneoff increase in national debt during the pandemic if money and debt are substitutes just swapping one for another as qe does might provide little stimulus consistent with the experience of the but expanding their combined supply can be powerfully inflationary right on the money the logical extreme of this argument is known as the fiscal theory of the price level created in the early and in the process of being refreshed john cochrane of stanford university has written pagebook on the subject this says that the outstanding stock of government money and debt is bit like the shares of company its value ie how much it can buy adjusts to reflect future fiscal policy should the government be insufficiently committed to running surpluses to repay its debts the public will be like shareholders expecting dilution the result is inflation explaining today high inflation does not require you to go that far though it is enough to look at recent deficits rather than to peer into the future yet it is striking that economists like mr andolfatto who focused on the supply of government liabilities foresaw today predicament while most central bankers whose eyes were fixed firmly on labour markets as gauge of inflationary pressure did not the past decade has shown that when interest rates fall to zero it takes more than just qe to escape lowinflation world still friedmanism lives on»\n",

20 commodities has climbed 53 over the past 12 months  commodity costs are only a small component of most consumer prices of course as the chart on page 32 shows the consumer price index doesn’t move up or down as dramatically as the indexes for producers at various stages of production nonetheless it’s worth noting that oil the most important industrial commodity has been a catalyst for every big spike in consumer price inflation since the early 1970s  wages are the biggest expense for most companies and they too are moving up some observers interpreted the big shortfall in april jobs growth—a payroll increase of just 266000 vs the expected 1 million—as a sign that demand for workers is flagging and so they conclude that runaway inflation isn’t an imminent threat another way to read the may 7 report from the bureau of labor statistics is that job growth is being held back by a shortage of workers in which case businesses will have few options but to hike pay to fill openings under this scenario inflation becomes a clear and present danger as bloomberg opinion columnist mohamed elerian wrote on may 10  although payrolls are still down 8 million jobs data released on may 11 showed the national jobvacancy rate has shot up to 53 the highest since records began in 2000 fear of covid childcare issues skills mismatches and generous jobless benefits are all suspected factors in why workers are staying home to lure them companies are offering signing bonuses and raising wages the employment cost index which covers both wages and benefits rose in the first quarter at the fastest pace since 2007  some companies are passing along their higher labor and materials costs to customers according to transcripts of earnings calls with analysts “straight price increases will continue to be an important element as we look at the back half of the year” noel wallace chief executive officer of colgate palmolive co said on april 30 paul jacobson general motors co’s chief financial officer told analysts on may 5 that the automaker’s average transaction price was up 9 yearoveryear in the first quarter “helping to overcome headwinds from commodity inflation and lower volumes” tyson foods inc chief operating officer donnie king said on may 10 “we certainly can’t eat all the inflation that we’re experiencing now”  fiscal and monetary stimulus are also pushing up prices federal net outlays hit 31 of gross domestic product in the final quarter of 2020 way above the recent average of about 20 the biden administration has kept the pedal to the metal since then with the 19 trillion american rescue plan and is seeking congress’s approval for other spending and the federal reserve has maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 025 while continuing to buy 120 billion a month of treasury and mortgagebacked securities to hold down longterm rates  fed officials say higher inflation is precisely what they want a bit of predictable inflation lubricates commerce and gives the central bank room to push down inflationadjusted rates to revive the economy next time there’s a crisis on april 28 the federal open market committee fomc unanimously reaffirmed its commitment to achieving inflation “moderately above 2 for some time” to compensate for the many years it was under 2  fed chair jerome powell has repeatedly stressed that the current inflationary pressures are “transitory” and that it’s too early to even talk about tightening monetary policy while unemployment remains this high “we have pentup demand in the economy” said fed vice chair richard clarida on may 12 calling the april inflation figure just “one data point” he added “it may take some time for supply to rise up to demand”  he and others point out that the elevated yearoveryear inflation readings are distorted by extremely weak prices from the coviddamaged economy a year ago—and say that toohigh inflation is easier for the fed to fix than toolow inflation  the one thing that could get the fed to raise rates soon would be evidence that consumers and businesses are beginning to expect high inflation which can become a selffulfilling prophecy there’s no sign of that happening yet clarida said in an april 14 speech he pointed to a fed staff compilation of 21 indicators from households companies professional forecasters and markets showing that expected inflation was 2 in the first quarter on target  some wall streeters say the fed is right to stay the course “we do not see the sort of inflationary pressures that markets appear to be fearing and high growth rates will not necessarily translate into a higher inflation rate” says praveen korapaty goldman sachs group inc’s chief interestrate strategist  that may well turn out to be right at the moment though the mood is fearful and the more the fed tries to reassure people that inflation is nothing to worry about the more some people will conclude that it’s about to get out of hand')\n"

      "labeledArticle(articleID=18, label='Expect Inflation', body='one of the most important signals of future inflation has begun to ease in the past month a development that should reassure the federal reserve in its prediction that the recent inflation surge will prove largely temporary  that signal is socalled inflation expectations what businesses consumers workers and investors expect inflation to be over the next one to 10 years because such expectations can be selffulfilling economists consider them key to where inflation is going  expectations are tracked through a range of surveys and marketbased measures and most are telling the same story after rising sharply from october through may they have now begun to ease  the median expectation of inflation during the next year for consumers surveyed by the university of michigan shot to 48 this month the highest since august 2008 however consumers’ oneyear expectations are strongly influenced by today’s inflation rate now a 13year high of 54 a morereassuring message comes from their expectations for five to 10 years from now that came in at 29 in early july down slightly from 3 in may and close to the average of 28 in surveys from 2000 to 2019  bond investors also don’t seem to be betting on a sustained jump in inflation based on the “breakeven inflation rate”—the difference between the yield on regular treasury bonds and on inflationindexed bonds the breakeven rate over the next five years has dropped 019 percentage point since midmay the rate over the following five years has dropped 021 point  moreover since january the fiveyear breakeven inflation rate has been higher than the 10year rate the first time that has happened consistently since 2008 “what the markets are saying is ‘we think there’s inflation in the near term but eventually it’s going to ease and goback to the fed’s 2 target—maybe be a little above but it will certainly not remain elevated’” said kathy bostjancic chief us financial economist at oxford economics  business inflation expectations have declined too since may as tracked by the federal reserve bank of atlanta’s monthly survey of around 300 businesses in six states companies expected 28 infl ation a year from now in early july on average down from 3 in june though up from the average of 19 from 2012 to 2019 the survey measures businesses’ expectations of their own costs which may not translate to selling prices  in theory individuals and businesses set prices and wages based on what they expect inflation to be in the future thus expectations can be selffulfilling “consumers say ‘inflation is going up—i’m going to have to pay higher prices’ and go to their employers and ask for higher wages” ms bostjancic said businesses see that rising inflation gives them room to raise prices and grant raises recouping those increased costs by charging more she said “it’s intuitive but also borne out by empirical evidence”  in the fed’s economic models inflation is largely determined by slack—how much labor and business capacity is going unused—and inflation expectations “there is broad agreement that achieving price stability on a sustainable basis requires that longrun inflation expectations be well anchored at the rate of inflation consistent with the pricestability goal” said richard clarida the fed’s vice chairman in an april speech  in the 1960s economists thought there was a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment—a relationship called the phillips curve—and policy makers could lower unemployment by allowing higher inflation but scholars such as the late nobel laureate milton friedman argued that workers would respond to higher inflation by expecting and receiving higher wages which would tend to push unemployment back up to its old level that is what happened in the 1970s unemployment went up but inflation didn’t go down because expectations were high  conversely low stable expected inflation over the 10 years before the coronavirus pandemic may explain why the fed struggled to bring inflation consistently up to its 2 target even as unemployment fell to historic lows last year inflation expectations plummeted as the economy sank into recession but as the economy rebounded so did expectations to above prepandemic levels  that could be good news for the fed said tim duy chief us economist at sgh macro advisors because it could help the fed keep inflation on its 2 target based on historical patterns expected inflation slightly above 2 would still be consistent with actual inflation at2  the fed’s staff has compiled a “common inflation expectations” index from 21 measures of inflation expectations including short and longterm indexes from consumers markets businesses and professional forecasters that index in the second quarter was at levels that prevailed in 2014 a time when inflation was modest the fed indicated in minutes of its june meeting  but some economists worry inflation expectations could rise steadily from here trillions of dollars in federal pandemic relief and ample household savings have helped buoy demand that along with pandemicrelated supply chain disruptions is giving businesses more pricing power than they have had in decades said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economics llc  “what that could lead to is extended periods of raising prices rather than fear that if they raise prices they’ll lose market share” he said  that fear may indeed be receding a year ago raising prices was the last thing aaron pool wanted to think about when the founder and coowner of the gadzooks enchiladas and soup restaurants chain in arizona raised the price for two enchiladas by 25 cents in 2013 he faced customer backlash  emerging from lockdown in the spring of 2020 a state minimumwage law and higher commodity and delivery costs pushed him to raise prices yet demand stayed strong  “i believe inflation is real because customers haven’t said a peep about it” mr pool said “it’s 925 for two enchiladas right now we joke we could probably raise it to 13 and people would pay it”  anmol sahai of brooklyn ny noticed prices at restaurants and bars in the city shooting up a few months ago the price for a morning uber soared to more than 40 nearly double the prepandemic rate  “i feel like may was the first time i was like ‘oh my god this is getting out of hand’” said mrsahai who is 25 years old and works as a paralegal  in his case though higher inflation hasn’t yet changed his behavior in a way that suggests his expectations are becoming unanchored he cut back on dining out and now takes the subway to work but while mr sahai is planning to ask for a raise soon he doesn’t connect that to higher costs  “i’ll ask for more regardless but how much will inflation influence that not much” he said“i think of them differently there’s my job on one side and how much i spend on the other”')\n"
